# Business logic files

The business logic of the application is documented in the files from folder ./references . When changes are made to the application that affect its behavior, the documents should be updated to reflect those changes. This ensures that future agents can easily understand the app's functionality and make informed decisions when working with it.
The main business logic files are:

- [main-business-logic.md](./references/main-business-logic.md)
- [app-features.md](./references/app-features.md)

# When to use this skill

- Use this skill when you need to understand the current business logic of the application.
- Use this skill when you need to update the business logic documentation after changes have been made to the application.
- Use this skill to ensure that the business logic documentation is accurate and up-to-date for future agents.

# How to extract business logic from app files

1. Identify the relevant business logic file(s) based on the changes made to the application.
2. Open the identified file(s) and read through the content to understand the current business logic.
